# eBPF Packet Sniffer (BCC)

A simple Linux kernel-level packet sniffer built using **eBPF** and **BCC**.  
This tool captures network packets, displays their source & destination IP addresses, protocol, size, and also maintains live stats (TCP/UDP/Other packet counts and total bytes).  

---

## üöÄ Features
- Uses **eBPF** to attach directly to the Linux network stack
# eBPF Packet Sniffer (BCC)

---

## üöÄ Features
- Uses **eBPF** to attach directly to the Linux network stack
- Displays:
  - Source and destination IPs
  - Protocol (TCP, UDP, Other)
  - Packet size in bytes
- Live stats:
  - Total packets captured
  - Protocol breakdown (TCP, UDP, Other)
  - Total bytes processed
- Runs in **real-time** with minimal overhead  

---

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)**  
- **BCC (BPF Compiler Collection)**  
- **Python 3** (for user-space program)  
- **Linux Kernel (WSL2 or native)**  

---
